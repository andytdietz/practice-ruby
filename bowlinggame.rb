# Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should have two methods: roll which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and score which is called at the end and returns the total game score.

# Initialize the Bowling Game:

# class Bowling_Game
#   def initialize(points)
#     @points = points
#   end
# end

# game1 = Bowling_Game.new(150)
# pp game1

# Rolling a Ball:

# def rolls(roll1, roll2)
#   frame = []
#   frame.push(roll1, roll2)
# end

# pp rolls(4, 9)

# Calculating Score for a Single Frame:
# def frame_total(roll1, roll2)
#   frame_total = roll1 + roll2
#   frame_total
# end

# pp frame_total(4, 3)

# Tracking Frames:
# frame = 1
# while frame <= 10
#   puts "#{frame}: "
#   frame = frame + 1
# end

# Handling Strikes:
result = 10

def is_strike?(frame2)
  if roll1 == 10
  total = result + frame2
  

# Handling Spares:

# Scoring Multiple Frames:

# Final Frame Logic:

# Edge Cases and Validation:

# Testing
